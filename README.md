# Climate-Indices-Calculation
The ipynb notebook and Data for indices calculation

The Code link is here you can see all the outputs of 121x121x365 indices as well as the yearly values of all the indices in the code. ->  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-csYaf0Uh22sJ9uiTyNdZImbaf5NOF7J/view?usp=sharing

you dont have to run the code. The code is already run and all the outputs are also saved in the links given in the mail below.
I am providing the code link so that other students can use these results in similar work for future.

This is the drive link of all the Files - As the files are above 100Mb they can't be sent in the mail so I have added all the result files as mentioned in the points below in the Google drive which can be accessed by below link.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J9uyRKK7PVfJAqiRvP1FfzymPuk_16jJ?usp=sharing
i) The .mat files have indices values for the indices according to the name of that file
ii) The yealy outputs are added in the yearly_all_indices.txt file as well as the in the code file the outputs can be seen
iii) The .txt files for 121x121x365 values are output in the name of the indices.txt file for example for Rx5day it is Rx5dayvalues.txt
iv) All the plots which are generated in the code above are also added in the drive link above as png images.

There was an important but a minor mistake that I and Kamal discussed and corrected which is for converting 129x135 data of precipitation into 121x121 the indices that had to be taken is 4 to 124th index but I was taking 5 to 125 initially after factoring the 0 based indexing in python that part was improvised.
